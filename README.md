# ‚öñÔ∏è JudgeLib

**JudgeLib** is a scalable, Redis-backed Node.js library for secure and efficient online code execution. Designed for educational and competitive programming platforms, JudgeLib provides distributed execution, language support, and isolated process handling out of the box.

Link - [Doc](https://judge-lib-mg91.vercel.app/)

also make sure the workers are running as I am using Render, so the worker might be on sleep, and same for microservices, so that go the to [Doc](https://judge-lib-mg91.vercel.app/npm) in this try to ping worker (bascially we are trying to wake up the workers) and for microservice try to hit/open [link](https://judge-microser.onrender.com) so that Microservice will also be active

## üì¶ Installation

Install JudgeLib in your Node.js project:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install lib-judge

# Using yarn
yarn add lib-judge
```

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

Execute and evaluate code with just a few lines:

### Example (ES Modules)

```js
import { judge } from 'lib-judge';

const result = await judge({
  codePath: '/path/to/temp/file.py',
  ques_name: 'sum of array',
  input: '5 1 2 3 4 5 ### 3 1 2 3 ### 2 1 2',
  output: '15 ### 6 ### 3',
  timeout: 2,           // timeout per test case in seconds
  sizeout: 64,          // max output size in KB
  language: 'py'        // language code: 'py', 'cpp', 'java'
});

console.log(result);
```

## üåê Supported Languages

| Language | Version | Extension |
| -------- | ------- | --------- |
| Python   | 3.11    | `.py`     |
| Java     | 17      | `.java`   |
| C++      | GCC 11  | `.cpp`    |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Each submission is split into multiple test cases.
2. Test cases are pushed into a Redis queue.
3. Distributed workers poll the queue and process tasks.
4. Code is compiled (if needed), executed, and validated securely.
5. Results are aggregated and returned.

## üìà Performance Benchmarks

Currently deployed on [Render](https://render.com) with **3 active workers**.

| Metric            | Estimate                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Uptime            | \~98‚Äì99% (managed by Render)                |
| Avg Response Time | ~800‚Äì1500ms (0.8‚Äì1.5s) per test case (Render)   |
| Executions/Day    | \~20,000‚Äì40,000 test cases across 3 workers |

> üß† Scaling Plan:
> JudgeLib is designed to scale horizontally. As usage increases, more workers will be added monthly to maintain low latency and high throughput.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:
> Performance may vary based on code complexity, queue size, and server load.
